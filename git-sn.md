## 1. Git vs. GitHub: The Core Concept

It's crucial to understand the difference between **Git** and **GitHub**.

* **Git** is the tool you install on your computer. It's a version control system that tracks changes to your project files locally. Think of it as a "save game" system for your code, allowing you to create snapshots (commits) and travel back in time.

* **GitHub** is the service or website you visit. It's a cloud-based platform that hosts your Git repositories. It's the online home for your projects, making it easy to store backups and collaborate with other people.

In short: **Git** is the tool, **GitHub** is the place you store the projects you use the tool on.

## 2. The Core Git Workflow: Saving Your Work 💾

The process of saving changes in Git involves three stages. Understanding this is key to using Git effectively.

* **Working Directory**: This is your actual project folder on your computer where you edit your files. Any changes you make here are not yet saved by Git.
* **Staging Area (or Index)**: This is a "drafting" or "preparation" area. You add the specific changes you want to save from your Working Directory to the Staging Area. This allows you to group related changes together into a single, clean snapshot.
* **Repository (.git folder)**: This is the permanent "photo album" of your project. When you commit, Git takes everything in the Staging Area and saves it as a permanent snapshot (a commit) in the repository.

### Essential Commands for the Workflow:

* `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in your current folder. (Run only once per project).
* `git clone [url]`: Copies an entire repository from a remote location (like GitHub) to your computer.
* `git status`: Your most important command. It tells you the status of your files in the working directory and staging area.
* `git add [file]` or `git add .`: Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.
* `git commit -m "Your descriptive message"`: Takes the snapshot from the staging area and saves it permanently to your repository's history.

## 3. Branching & Merging: Working in Parallel 🌳

Branches are parallel timelines of your project that let you work on new features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main, stable version of your code.

The main, official branch is usually called **`main`**. You create a feature branch to do your work, and when you're done, you merge that feature branch back into **`main`**.

### Branching Workflow & Commands:

* `git branch`: Lists all branches. The one you are on is marked with a `*`.
* `git branch [branch-name]`: Creates a new branch.
* `git checkout [branch-name]`: Switches your working directory to the specified branch.
* **Do your work**: Make your changes and create commits on this new branch. The `main` branch remains untouched.
* `git checkout main`: When done, switch back to the `main` branch.
* `git merge [branch-name]`: Combines the history and changes from your feature branch into the `main` branch.

## 4. Collaboration: Working with Remotes (GitHub) ☁️

To collaborate, you need to sync your local repository with a remote repository (usually on GitHub).

A **remote** is a version of your repository hosted on the internet. **`origin`** is the default nickname for your main remote URL.

### Remote Commands:

* `git push`: Uploads your committed changes from your local repository to the remote repository. This is how you share your work.
* `git pull`: Downloads the latest changes from the remote repository and automatically merges them into your current local branch. This is how you get updates from others.

## 5. Advanced (but useful) Commands

These commands are powerful and can alter your project history. Use them with care, especially on your local branches.

### Rewriting History (⚠️ Use Caution)

* `git rebase [branch]`: Instead of merging, this command moves your branch's starting point to the tip of another branch. It rewrites your commits to create a cleaner, linear history. Use this to update your feature branch with the latest changes from `main` before merging.
* `git reset --hard [commit]`: A "demolition" command. It erases all commits and changes after a specific commit, resetting your entire project to that past state. Use this to completely discard recent, local mistakes that you have not pushed.

### Saving Unfinished Work

* `git stash`: A temporary clipboard for your uncommitted changes. It saves your work-in-progress and cleans your working directory so you can switch branches to handle an urgent task.
* `git stash pop`: Re-applies the last stashed changes back to your working directory.

## 6. Quick Note for Windows Users

The command `touch [filename]` is used to create empty files on Linux and macOS. It does not exist in Windows by default.

* In **PowerShell**, use: `New-Item [filename]`
* In the older **Command Prompt (CMD)**, use: `type nul > [filename]`

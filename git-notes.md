## 1. Git vs. GitHub: The Core Concept

It's crucial to understand the difference between **Git** and **GitHub**.

* **Git** is the tool you install on your computer. [cite_start]It's a free and open source distributed version control system that tracks changes to your project files locally[cite: 6]. Think of it as a "save game" system for your code, allowing you to create snapshots (commits) and travel back in time.

* **GitHub** is the service or website you visit. It's a cloud-based platform that hosts your Git repositories. It's the online home for your projects, making it easy to store backups and collaborate with other people.

In short: **Git** is the tool, **GitHub** is the place you store the projects you use the tool on.

## 2. One-Time Setup

Before you start using Git, you should configure your user information. [cite_start]This information will be associated with every commit you make[cite: 16].

* [cite_start]`git config --global user.name "[firstname lastname]"`: Sets a name that is identifiable for credit when you review version history[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]`git config --global user.email "[valid-email]"`: Sets an email address that will be associated with each history marker[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]`git config --global color.ui auto`: Sets automatic command line coloring for Git, which makes reviewing easier[cite: 19].

## 3. The Core Git Workflow: Saving Your Work üíæ

The process of saving changes in Git involves three stages. Understanding this is key to using Git effectively.

* **Working Directory**: This is your actual project folder on your computer where you edit your files. Any changes you make here are not yet saved by Git.
* [cite_start]**Staging Area (or Index)**: This is a "drafting" or "preparation" area[cite: 26]. You add the specific changes you want to save from your Working Directory to the Staging Area. This allows you to group related changes together into a single, clean snapshot.
* **Repository (.git folder)**: This is the permanent "photo album" of your project. When you commit, Git takes everything in the Staging Area and saves it as a permanent snapshot (a commit) in the repository.

### Essential Commands for the Workflow:

* [cite_start]`git init`: Initializes an existing directory as a Git repository[cite: 22]. (Run only once per project).
* [cite_start]`git clone [url]`: Retrieves an entire repository from a hosted location via a URL[cite: 24].
* `git status`: Your most important command. [cite_start]It shows modified files in your working directory and files staged for your next commit[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]`git add [file_name]` or `git add .`: Adds a file as it looks now to your next commit (this is called "staging")[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]`git reset [file]`: Unstages a file while keeping the changes in your working directory[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]`git diff`: Shows the differences between what has changed in your working directory but is not staged[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]`git diff-staged`: Shows the differences between what is staged and what was last committed[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]`git commit -m "Your descriptive message"`: Commits your staged content as a new snapshot in the repository's history[cite: 27].
* `git remote add origin <URL>.git`: Add the remote repository to your working directory, giving it a nickname, origin.
* `git remote -v`: Verify the remote URL.

## 4. Branching & Merging: Working in Parallel üå≥

[cite_start]Branches are parallel timelines of your project that let you work on new features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main, stable version of your code[cite: 29].

The main, official branch is usually called **`main`**. You create a feature branch to do your work, and when you're done, you merge that feature branch back into **`main`**.

### Branching Workflow & Commands:

* [cite_start]`git branch`: Lists all of your branches[cite: 31]. [cite_start]A `*` will appear next to the currently active branch[cite: 31].
* [cite_start]`git branch [branch-name]`: Creates a new branch at the current commit[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]`git checkout [branch-name]`: Switches to another branch and checks it out into your working directory[cite: 34].
* **Do your work**: Make your changes and create commits on this new branch. The `main` branch remains untouched.
* `git checkout main`: When done, switch back to the `main` branch.
* [cite_start]`git merge [branch-name]`: Merges the specified branch's history into your current one[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]`git log`: Shows all commits in the current branch's history[cite: 38].
* `git branch -m main`: Rename the 'master' branch to 'main', provided that it's already `git checkout [master]`. `-m` flag stands for "move," which is how Git renames a branch.
* `git push -u origin main`: Push the new 'main' branch to the remote repository. `-u` flag sets main as the default upstream branch, so in the future, you can just use `git push` in stead of `git push origin main` /or `git pull` in stead of `git pull origin main`.
* `git push origin --delete master`: Delete the old 'master' branch from the remote repository.

## 5. Collaboration: Working with Remotes (GitHub) ‚òÅÔ∏è

[cite_start]To collaborate, you need to sync your local repository with a remote repository (usually on GitHub)[cite: 61].

A **remote** is a version of your repository hosted on the internet. **`origin`** is the default nickname for your main remote URL.

### Remote Commands:

* [cite_start]`git fetch [alias]`: Fetches down all the branches from a Git remote[cite: 62].
* [cite_start]`git merge [alias]/[branch]`: Merges a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date[cite: 62].
* [cite_start]`git push <nick_name> <branch_name>`: Transmits local branch commits to the remote repository branch[cite: 62]. Ex: `git push origin main`
* `git pull = git fetch + git merge`
* [cite_start]`git pull`: Fetches and merges any commits from the tracking remote branch[cite: 62].
* `git pull <nick_name> <branch_name>`: pull the latest changes from origin‚Äôs <branch_name> branch into my current branch. Ex: `git pull origin main`

## 6. Inspecting the History üîç

[cite_start]These commands help you examine logs, differences between commits, and object information[cite: 41].

* [cite_start]`git log`: Shows the commit history for the currently active branch[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]`git log branchB..branchA`: Shows the commits that are on branchA but not on branchB[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]`git log-follow [file]`: Shows the commits that changed a specific file, even if the file was renamed[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]`git diff branchB...branchA`: Shows the difference of what is in branchA that is not in branchB[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]`git show [SHA]`: Shows any object in Git (like a commit) in a human-readable format[cite: 42].

---

## 7. Tracking File Changes üìÇ

[cite_start]Git can also track when files are moved or removed[cite: 44].

* [cite_start]`git rm [file]`: Deletes a file from your project and stages that removal for the next commit[cite: 46].
* [cite_start]`git mv [existing-path] [new-path]`: Changes an existing file path and stages the move[cite: 48].
* [cite_start]`git log--stat -M`: Shows all commit logs with an indication of any paths that were moved or renamed[cite: 50].

---

## 8. Ignoring Files üôà

[cite_start]You can tell Git to ignore certain files or patterns so they aren't accidentally staged or committed[cite: 52].

* This is done by creating a file named `.gitignore`.
* [cite_start]You can list direct file or folder names (`Logs/`) or use wildcards (`*.notes`) to ignore patterns of files[cite: 53, 54, 57].
* [cite_start]`git config --global core.excludesfile [file]`: Sets up a system-wide ignore pattern for all of your local repositories[cite: 59].

---

## 9. Advanced (but useful) Commands

These commands are powerful and can alter your project history. Use them with care, especially on your local branches.

### Rewriting History (‚ö†Ô∏è Use Caution)

* [cite_start]`git rebase [branch]`: Applies any commits of the current branch ahead of the specified one[cite: 66]. This rewrites your commits to create a cleaner, linear history. Use this to update your feature branch with the latest changes from `main` before merging.
* `git reset --hard [commit]`: A "demolition" command. [cite_start]It clears the staging area and rewrites your working tree from a specified commit[cite: 68]. Use this to completely discard recent, local mistakes that you have not pushed.

### Saving Unfinished Work

* [cite_start]`git stash`: Saves your modified and staged changes temporarily[cite: 71].
* [cite_start]`git stash list`: Lists the stack-order of your stashed file changes[cite: 71].
* [cite_start]`git stash pop`: Re-applies the changes from the top of the stash stack to your working directory[cite: 71].
* [cite_start]`git stash drop`: Discards the changes from the top of the stash stack[cite: 71].

## 10. Quick Note for Windows Users

The command `touch [filename]` is used to create empty files on Linux and macOS. It does not exist in Windows by default.

* In **PowerShell**, use: `New-Item [filename]`
* In the older **Command Prompt (CMD)**, use: `type nul > [filename]`
